Title:Sky-GVIO: an enhanced GNSS/INS/Vision navigation with FCN-based sky-segmentation in urban canyon

Introduction of dataset
We briefly introduce our sky-view images dataset, including the training dataset and the testing dataset. The training dataset contains 440 images and the testing dataset contains 2000 images. These data were collected in typical urban canyons in two different areas of Wuhan, which contain trees, tall buildings, and light poles. Therefore, this dataset is very suitable for sky-view images segmentation experiments.
